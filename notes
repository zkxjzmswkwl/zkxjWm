Things that are currently fucking dumb that I'd like to be less dumb

- I was lazy and based everything around window title substrs rather than pids
	- Issues caused by this include
		- If you have a window open that has the same substr as the target window, you're going to have a bad time.
		- Configuration fuckery

- I don't think I want to use toml for the config file. I hate change.
	- Doesn't matter right now. No one uses this but me.

- Implement the way windows are iterated over in a non-stupid-as-fuck manner.
	- Currently each time a call to `WindowManager::get_window()` is made, all primary windows are enumerated.
	- this is fucking dumb.
		- Does Windows have a better way to do this?
			- Benchmark current solution to see if it's as bad as I think it is.
				- it probably is

- Implement even growing/shrinking of in-focus window.
	- For example if I want to make the in-focus window larger, I could assign a hotkey to do so.
	- However, I don't want it to grow in one direction. I want the growth evenly split and the window repositioned.

- Make centering actually configurable??

- Rename WindowManager to windowmanager or some other shit that's at least consistent
